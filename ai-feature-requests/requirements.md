# Requirements Document - MVP

## Introduction

The Mood Board Creator MVP is a simple, visual organization tool that allows users to drag and drop images from their desktop onto a canvas with basic grid snapping. This MVP focuses on core functionality for rapid prototyping and exploration without complex features.

## MVP Requirements

### Requirement 1: File Upload via Drag and Drop

**User Story:** As a creative professional, I want to drag and drop multiple images from my desktop directly onto a canvas, so that I can quickly upload and organize visual references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags image files from their desktop THEN the system SHALL accept the drop anywhere on the canvas
2. WHEN a user drops multiple image files simultaneously THEN the system SHALL upload all images at once
3. WHEN a user drops supported image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP) THEN the system SHALL successfully process and display them
4. WHEN a user drops unsupported file types THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback

### Requirement 2: Simple Grid Snapping

**User Story:** As a designer collecting visual inspiration, I want images to automatically snap to a grid system, so that I can create organized layouts without manual alignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is placed THEN it SHALL retain its original aspect ratio with a maximum width of 700px
2. WHEN an image is dragged near a grid point THEN the system SHALL automatically snap it to the nearest grid position
3. WHEN two images are positioned THEN the system SHALL prevent any overlap
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL be arranged in a clean grid pattern

### Requirement 3: Basic Canvas Navigation

**User Story:** As a user organizing images, I want to navigate across the canvas with zoom and pan controls, so that I can view my collection at different detail levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls the mouse wheel THEN the system SHALL zoom in or out smoothly
2. WHEN a user holds spacebar and drags THEN the system SHALL activate pan mode with hand cursor
3. WHEN panning is active THEN the system SHALL provide smooth movement across the canvas

### Requirement 4: Image Management

**User Story:** As a user arranging visual content, I want to reposition and manage individual images on the canvas, so that I can create my mood board layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks and drags an image THEN the system SHALL allow repositioning to new grid positions
2. WHEN an image is dropped THEN the system SHALL snap it to the nearest valid grid position
3. WHEN a user wants to remove an image THEN the system SHALL provide a way to delete individual images
4. WHEN repositioning THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratios

### Requirement 5: Session Storage

**User Story:** As a user creating quick prototypes, I want my work to be stored temporarily in the session, so that I can focus on rapid ideation without persistence complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads and arranges images THEN the system SHALL store all data in browser memory
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL clear all board data
3. WHEN the session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain all image positions
4. WHEN working with the board THEN the system SHALL not require any backend connections

### Requirement 6: Basic User Experience

**User Story:** As a user working with visual content, I want clear visual feedback and intuitive controls, so that I can efficiently organize my images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is ready for file drops THEN it SHALL provide clear visual indicators
2. WHEN images are being dragged THEN the system SHALL show appropriate cursor states
3. WHEN grid snapping occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for snap positions
4. WHEN interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide smooth user experience
